# TF_colocalization_3Dchromatin
Pipeline to find colocalizing TF pairs in 3D chromatin

This is a pipeline to find transcription factor(TF) pairs co-localizing in spatially proximal chromatin regions. Also, the pipeline finds the same co-localizing TF pairs in sequential contiguous i.e. on linear genome.
